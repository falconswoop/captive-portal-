hotspot customer validation with user name and password or alpha numeric randomly generated code
I am using the ubiquity unifi mesh wireless network devices deployed in a campground
I am using the cloud Key as my server and security gateway.
I'm not certain if anyone is familiar with this system but the Hotshot option included with the controller is very dry, my requirements are more along the line of a software called Antimedia hotspot.
There is software written for the Linux operating system but I am not versed in Linux .
also the unifi controller and security gateway must be 1st and foremost in control of the network traffic in order for this system to operate properly.
There is an option In the unified controller  setup to use an external Server for the validation process but I could not make it work properly.
